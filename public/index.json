While studying CS in SMU, and also studying offensive security on the side, I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt the importance of a checklist. A checklist helps to ensure that all basic checks were done, all the i\u0026rsquo;s were dotted, and all the t\u0026rsquo;s were crossed.\nHowever, with that said, one could always argue for the usage of automated tools, or even AI, which defeats the point of a checklist. In my opinion, this argument itself defeats the point of education- What\u0026rsquo;s the point of using automated tools if I don\u0026rsquo;t even know what I\u0026rsquo;m running? It defeats the point of education, and learning. And worse still, just blindly running it leaves you at the mercy of the tool itself. What if you\u0026rsquo;ve run some malicious code? If it\u0026rsquo;s on just a local, self-hosted asset then it\u0026rsquo;ll be fine- your own computer information was leaked, but in the first place, Windows Defender does a good enough job of preventing most attacks and vulnerabilities, so you should be fine (I use WSL and not a pure linux distribution because my surface pro is an old model, is 5 years old, and already takes 10 minutes to build a simple docker container, so I\u0026rsquo;ll rather not tempt fate by installing a new distro). Additionally, I have a poor opinion of even using AI to generate anything important. I had a conversation with a friend who was telling me about his entire \u0026ldquo;Workflow\u0026rdquo;. Naturally, I thought it was a CI/CD workflow and given that that\u0026rsquo;s one of the modules in SMU (which I\u0026rsquo;m currently taking and also doing a DevOps Project on with a local K8 setup), I thought I could learn some tips. Turns out it was just an AI workflow, and when I pressed for further details about whether it implemented any DevOps practices (such as codescanning tools for DevSecOps, or maybe some Chaos Engineering in Production to test system recovery), I got scant details, and an admittance that he had no clue how it worked under the hood.\nTherefore, this Checklist stands for what I think to be important- Just a checklist. The planned features include:\nFurther customisation of steps (This will be a constant WIP as I do more boxes/take more exams etc) Some sort of report export function which just entails pressing the export function to generate a PDF to show which steps have been done, and what screenshots were attached to said step Maybe the ability to add some text to each step, but honestly this is a huge maybe simply because I was never trained in frontend development. My knowledge of JS is really basic Adding a docker-compose.yaml since it\u0026rsquo;s easy to do, though I don\u0026rsquo;t really think it\u0026rsquo;s needed since you can just use the web version and check the code yourself to see that no calls can or are made to external APIs\u0026hellip; What is already included is literally\nA checklist (You can click the boxes and the task strikes out and also fades to grey) A progress bar (The colors could use somework, I admit I use GPT for color combinations\u0026hellip;) A tool bar at the side (No clue whether it works though, I didn\u0026rsquo;t add enough dummy tasks to check) Check it out here! HectorLeeYE/Pentest-CTF-Checklist My personal pentest-ctf checklist. It\u0026rsquo;s easier to deploy on a repo. It\u0026rsquo;s obviously a work in progress JavaScript 0 0 It\u0026rsquo;s meant to be client-sided so there\u0026rsquo;s 0 input validation, 0 security measures consciously made! I don\u0026rsquo;t think security measures are needed as it\u0026rsquo;s not meant to be well, run as a service.
